=head1 Krita build script
=cut
=head2 Preparation

Install MinGW & MSYS -- MSYS is only for its Perl. Alternatively install a Perl interpretor.

Install CMake, either through `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake` -- or the corresponding 32-bit version if you are building on a 32-bit system -- or by yourself (you need to manually add it to PATH)

Install Boost in MinGW, through `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-boost` -- the Boost in krita-deps will only be found if we use MinGW 7.3, not any other version

Install Python 3.6

Download and unpack krita-deps.zip -- the download link is at https://binary-factory.kde.org/job/Krita_Nightly_Windows_Dependency_Build/

Fetch the source code of krita

=head2 Editing configurations

Turn to `Config Part' and edit the directories as needed

Create the directories specified by `$kritaBuildDir`
=cut
=head2 Running the script

You should have received a copy of the Perl interpreter from MSYS

Invoke the script with:

    <msysDir>/usr/bin/perl.exe <path-to>/krita-build.perl ARGS

In the following lines I will use `<krita-build>` to denote `<msysDir>/usr/bin/perl.exe <path-to>/krita-build.perl`.

First, modify some hardcoded paths in krita-deps:

    <krita-build> prepare

Then, run cmake:

    cd <kritaBuildDir>
    <krita-build> cmake

Then, compile the sources:

    <krita-build> build

Then, install:

    <krita-build> install

If you use an IDE like KDevelop or QtCreator, you can try to launch your IDE from this script,
after you have run cmake on the sources (and then choose the build directory in your IDE).
This will automatically add the suitable environment variables so that your IDE can find the
correct libraries.

To make sure Krita can correctly run, some libraries need to be linked in the krita installation directory,
if you do not want to create an installer (chances are you want to keep both your build and another one,
say, the stable version).
If you are using a windows with symlink support (via mklink), you can run the following command to do so.
You will probably need to run *As Administrator*:

    <krita-build> link-deps

Alternatively, if your system does not support symlinks, copy these directories to your installation directory.

It is probably a good idea to use the same set of environment vairables to run krita. You can do so by:

    <krita-build> run

Alternatively, permanently add `<pythonDir>;<depsDir>/bin;<depsDir>/lib;<mingwDir>/bin` to your PATH, in Control Panel.

You will probably encounter the problem that Krita's startup is *very* slow. See https://docs.krita.org/en/KritaFAQ.html#slow-start-up and add an exception for the krita directory.

`install` will also trigger `build` so if you want to build AND install,
`build` can be skipped to avoid re-scanning of all targets.
